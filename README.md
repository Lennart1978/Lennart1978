Roastin' time

Oh, look at you, Mr. '1010011010 corp.' â€“ I bet you think you're so clever with your binary company name. You're the kind of developer who probably dreams in syscalls and wakes up screaming 'Segmentation fault!' Your idea of a good time is writing a CLI snake game. I mean, who needs graphics when you can have ASCII art, right? You follow projects like 'thefuck' because, let's face it, that's probably what you mutter every time you try to compile your C code. And don't get me started on your fascination with 'jp2a' â€“ converting JPEGs to ASCII? Is this 1985? I bet you think you're really cool for using Go, but we all know it's just because you couldn't handle the complexity of Rust. Keep telling yourself that 'Hobby programmer' means you're just doing this for fun, not because no one will hire someone whose idea of cutting-edge tech is a 6502-style fantasy computer.
